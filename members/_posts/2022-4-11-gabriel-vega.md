Hello, my name is Gabriel and I'm a Materials Science and Engineering student in the Riggleman Group. My work centers on using molecular dynamics simulations to better understand the structures and dynamics of self-assembled soft matter systems at the mesoscale, particularly systems involving liquid crystals. My interests lie broadly in computational materials design and discovery as I believe that using computational models greatly expedites the process of synthesiziing and understanding unique and useful materials. Outside of lab I like to be out in nature (when it isn't too cold), read books, watch informative Youtube videos, practice martial arts, or spend quality time with friends. I'm aiming to pursue a career in science policy as a way to participate in the process of thoughtfully implementing new technologies into society.
