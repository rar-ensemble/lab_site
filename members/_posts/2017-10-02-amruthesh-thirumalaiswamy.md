I'm a PhD student in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering co-advised by Prof. [John Crocker](https://crocker.seas.upenn.edu). I'm studying the rheology of soft glassy matter through simulations and developing toy models to explain the system dynamics.

I received my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).
